## Our Project

**DataKit** is an open source data collection and logging platform. Its goal is to free users from proprietary software (**Vernier**) and wasting money ($500+) on expensive hardware.

With **DataKit**, you can collect data from the variety of sensors already present in your smartphone. Just connect any computer with our client software installed, and plug in your own hardware sensors; **DataKit** takes care of data transfer, collection, and logging.
